          Query the GraphQL endpoint for `sessions` and display the results.
          Present them in a way that both looks nice and gets across the key
          information clearly.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each result, show the number of people registered as attending.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add functionality that allows the current user to register and
          unregister for a session, using the `register` and `unregister`
          mutations. Show on each result whether the current user is registered.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have time, add some client-side filtering and/or sorting: this
          could be e.g. a text search, or a filter on date.

          Once you've added some GraphQL queries and/or mutations, you can

          `frontend` folder.
